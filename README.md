# push_swap
## Overview
The Push Swap project is a straightforward algorithmic challenge where the goal is to sort a set of integer values using two stacks and a set of manipulation instructions. The task is to write a program, named push_swap, in C that sorts the integers provided in the input, as well as output the operations it took to do so.

## Features
- Efficent algorithm that sorts the input integers with a minimal number of commands;
- Error handling features that only accepts input that contains no syntax errors, no repetitions and is not bigger than an integer;
- Thorough Testing and Debugging: The program has undergone rigorous testing against memory leaks and runtime errors using tools like Valgrind, ensuring robustness and stability in execution.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com/dianazinchenko/push_swap.git
```
2. Go inside the push_swap folder and compile using the Makefile
```bash
cd push_swap
make
